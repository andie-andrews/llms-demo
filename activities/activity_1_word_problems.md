# Activity 1: LLM word problems

**Objective:** Practice basic prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning by solving word problems with an LLM.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Overview

In this activity, you'll work through a series of word problems using an LLM. You'll start with basic prompts and progressively apply techniques from Lesson 46 to improve the results. This hands-on practice will help you understand when and how to use different prompting strategies.

---

## Setup

### Option 1: Use the chatbot demos (recommended)

Both chatbot scripts in this repo work interactively - you can have a multi-turn conversation with the LLM. This is perfect for iterating on your prompts.

**Start the Ollama chatbot:**
```bash
# In one terminal, make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# In another terminal, run the chatbot
python src/ollama_chatbot.py
```

**Or start the llama.cpp chatbot:**
```bash
# Make sure the llama-server is running (see README for full command)
# Then run the chatbot
python src/llamacpp_chatbot.py
```

### How to use the chatbots for word problems

1. **Start basic:** Type the word problem question directly into the chat
   ```
   User: A baker made 60 cookies. She sold 2/3 of them...
   ```

2. **Try again with improvements:** The conversation remembers context, so you can say:
   ```
   User: Let me try that again with more structure. [paste question]
   Let's think step by step.
   ```

3. **Start fresh if needed:** Type `exit` to quit and restart the script for a clean conversation

### Adapting the chatbot for specific techniques

**To use chain-of-thought consistently:**

You can modify the chatbot's system prompt before running it. For example, in `src/ollama_chatbot.py`, find this section:

```python
system_prompt = (
    'You are a helpful teaching assistant at an AI/ML boot camp.',
    'Answer questions in simple language with examples when possible.',
    'Answer in the style of a pirate and use nautical themed analogies.'
)
```

Change it to encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```python
system_prompt = (
    'You are a helpful math tutor. When solving problems, always show your '
    'work step by step. Break down complex problems into smaller steps and '
    'explain your reasoning clearly.'
)
```

**To test different approaches without modifying code:**

Just include your instructions in each message:
- "Solve this step by step: [problem]"
- "Show your work: [problem]"
- "Let's think through this carefully: [problem]"

### Tips for success

- **Copy-paste is your friend:** Keep the word problems in a text editor and paste them into the chat
- **Document your experiments:** Note which prompting strategy worked for each problem
- **Compare approaches:** Try the same problem with different prompts to see what changes
- **Use the conversation history:** The chatbot remembers previous messages, which can be helpful (or not!)

## Word problems

For each problem below:
1. Try a **basic prompt** first (just the question)
2. Observe the result - did it work? What went wrong?
3. Apply a **prompting technique** to improve it
4. Compare the results

### Problem 1: The cookie problem

**Question:** A baker made 60 cookies. She sold 2/3 of them in the morning and gave away half of the remaining ones in the afternoon. How many cookies does she have left?

**Your task:**
1. Ask the LLM with just the question
2. If it gets the wrong answer or makes mistakes, try adding:
   - **Chain-of-thought:** "Let's think step by step."
   - **Explicit structure:** Ask it to show its work for each step

**Hints:**
- Look for arithmetic errors (especially with fractions)
- The answer should be 10 cookies
- Chain-of-thought often helps with multi-step math

### Problem 2: The meeting scheduler

**Question:** Alice needs to schedule a meeting with Bob, Carol, and Dave. Alice is free on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Bob is free on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Carol is free on Monday and Wednesday. Dave is free on Wednesday and Friday. When can they all meet?

**Your task:**
1. Try with just the question
2. If the LLM struggles or gives unclear reasoning, try:
   - **Structured prompt:** Ask it to list each person's availability first
   - **Chain-of-thought:** Request step-by-step reasoning
   - **Output format:** Ask for the answer in a specific format

**Hints:**
- The answer is Wednesday
- Try asking it to create a table or matrix first
- Structured prompts help with complex logical problems

### Problem 3: The age puzzle

**Question:** Sarah is twice as old as Tom was when Sarah was as old as Tom is now. The sum of their current ages is 42. How old are they?

**Your task:**
1. Try basic prompt
2. This one is tricky! Try different approaches:
   - **Chain-of-thought:** "Let's work through this step by step"
   - **Context:** "This is an algebra problem. Let's define variables..."
   - **Constraints:** "Show your algebraic equations clearly"

**Hints:**
- This is a classic algebra problem
- Sarah is 24, Tom is 18
- The LLM may need multiple attempts or guidance
- Consider breaking it into smaller steps

### Problem 4: The train problem (with a trick!)

**Question:** A train leaves Station A heading to Station B at 60 mph. Another train leaves Station B heading to Station A at 40 mph. The stations are 300 miles apart. How far apart are the trains after 2 hours?

**Your task:**
1. Try basic prompt - does it answer correctly?
2. Try these techniques:
   - **Chain-of-thought:** Break down the problem
   - **Constraints:** "Calculate each train's distance traveled separately first"

**Hints:**
- Each train travels for 2 hours
- Train A: 60 mph × 2 = 120 miles
- Train B: 40 mph × 2 = 80 miles
- Distance remaining: 300 - 120 - 80 = 100 miles
- Watch for the LLM trying to solve "when will they meet" instead

### Problem 5: The tricky one

**Question:** A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many sheep are left?

**Your task:**
1. Try with just the question - does it get it right?
2. This is a language comprehension problem, not math!
3. If it gets it wrong, try:
   - **Chain-of-thought** to see its reasoning
   - **Rephrasing** the question for clarity

**Hints:**
- "All but 9" means 9 survive
- The answer is 9
- LLMs often want to do math (17 - 9) and get 8
- This illustrates the importance of careful problem reading

## Bonus challenge: Create your own

Think of a word problem that might be tricky for an LLM:
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tricky wording
- Common misconceptions
- Requires careful reading

Test it and see what prompting techniques help!

## Reflection questions

After completing the problems, consider:

1. **Which prompting techniques helped most?**
   - Chain-of-thought?
   - Structured formatting?
   - Explicit constraints?

2. **What types of problems were hardest for the LLM?**
   - Pure math?
   - Logic puzzles?
   - Language ambiguity?

3. **How did you adapt your prompting strategy?**
   - What worked?
   - What didn't?

4. **When would you use chain-of-thought in real applications?**

---

## Key takeaways

- **Chain-of-thought ("Let's think step by step")** significantly improves multi-step reasoning
- **Structure and formatting** help the LLM organize complex information
- **Language ambiguity** can trick LLMs just like humans
- **Iteration is key** - your first prompt rarely works perfectly
- **Different problems need different techniques** - there's no one-size-fits-all approach

## Next steps

Apply these techniques in Activity 2: Text summarization, where you'll build a practical application using prompting strategies.
